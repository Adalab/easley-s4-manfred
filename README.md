# Manfred Awesomic CV (MACv)📄 + 👩‍💻 = 🚀

Welcome to the first prototype of [Manfred Awesomic CV](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac).

## Repo instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

To make it work, you first have to install create-react-app by typing:
`npm install -g create-react-app`
Then, clone the repo & run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

In the project directory, you can run`npm start` to run the app in the development mode.<br>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Type `ctrl/cmd + c` to stop it from running.
